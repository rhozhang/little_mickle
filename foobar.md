> Many a little makes a mickle

The terms foobar, foo, bar, baz and qux are sometimes used as placeholder names 
(also referred to as metasyntactic variables) in computer programming or computer-related documentation. 
They have been used to name entities such as variables, functions, and commands whose purpose is 
unimportant and serve only to demonstrate a concept. The words themselves have no meaning in this usage

Foobar is sometimes used alone; foo, bar, and baz are sometimes used in that order, when multiple entities are needed
