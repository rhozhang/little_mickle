# ton, tonne, metric tonne, t, mt

tag: misc

**Metric tonne** (tonne, mt) is a unit based upon SI system and is equal to 1000 kilos

In the US, a *ton* (abbr. t) means 2000 pounds, or roughly 907 kg

In UK, prior to the introduction of the SI system, the **ton** that was used was equal to 2240 pounds (1016kg), 
and since this value is very close to actual metric tonne, people felt very little difference between 
the earlier ton and the metric tonne. This is why people in Britain continued to use the same old spelling

We Chinese use SI, 吨 = 公吨
